1. Defining Objective
I suggest implementing interactive non-Player Characters (NPCs) within the town. This feature will add depth to the town environment and provide opportunities for the player to gain information, receive quests (in future expansions), or purchase unique items. The NPCs will be visually represented on the town map and will have simple text-based interactions when the player moves onto the same map tile as an NPC.
2. Setting Goals & Plan Work
To implement interactive NPCs, I will break down the work into the following goals:
•	Represent NPCs on the Town Map: Create a way to define NPC locations and a visual representation for them on the town map within the Pygame window. This could be a different colored circle or a simple sprite.
•	Detect Player-NPC Interaction: Implement logic within the map exploration to detect when the player's position overlaps with an NPC's position.
•	Display NPC Interaction Text: When an interaction occurs, a text box or message will appear on the screen displaying a greeting or a short piece of dialogue from the NPC.
•	Define NPC Data: Create a data structure (e.g., a list of dictionaries) to store information about each NPC, such as their position on the map and the text they display.
