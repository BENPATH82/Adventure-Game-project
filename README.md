1. Defining Objective
I suggest implementing interactive non-Player Characters (NPCs) within the town. This feature will add depth to the town environment and provide opportunities for the player to gain information, receive quests (in future expansions), or purchase unique items. The NPCs will be visually represented on the town map and will have simple text-based interactions when the player moves onto the same map tile as an NPC.
2. Setting Goals & Plan Work
To implement interactive NPCs, I will break down the work into the following goals:
•	Represent NPCs on the Town Map: Create a way to define NPC locations and a visual representation for them on the town map within the Pygame window. This could be a different colored circle or a simple sprite.
•	Detect Player-NPC Interaction: Implement logic within the map exploration to detect when the player's position overlaps with an NPC's position.
•	Display NPC Interaction Text: When an interaction occurs, a text box or message will appear on the screen displaying a greeting or a short piece of dialogue from the NPC.
•	Define NPC Data: Create a data structure (e.g., a list of dictionaries) to store information about each NPC, such as their position on the map and the text they display.
3. Personal achievement: I successfully implement the NPCs that interact with the player.Briefly ,here is how it was made possible: A list called npcs was created to store dictionaries for each NPC. Each dictionary contains the NPC's name, their pos (position on the grid), and the dialogue they will display.In the drawing section of explore_map, the code now iterates through the npcs list and draws a yellow circle for each NPC at their specified position. Two new variables, interacting_with_npc (a boolean) and npc_interaction_text (a string), are introduced to manage the interaction state. After the player moves, the code checks if the new player position matches the position of any NPC in the npcs list.	If a match is found, interacting_with_npc is set to True, and npc_interaction_text is set to the NPC's dialogue. A message is also printed on the console.While interacting_with_npc is True, player movement is disabled. Pressing any key will set interacting_with_npc back to False, clearing the dialogue.I had challenges in syntaxes, indentation and lohgic or the order of some block of codes; therefore, I constantly used VS Code for help.
